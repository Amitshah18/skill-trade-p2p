// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading.jsx file contains code that uses variables like "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and"
// without declaring or importing them.  A common scenario is that these are intended to be boolean flags or
// part of a larger conditional statement.  Without the original code, I will declare them as boolean variables
// initialized to false to resolve the errors.  This is a reasonable assumption for a loading component.
